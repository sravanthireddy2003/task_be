# Cleaned Backend

This folder contains a trimmed and cleaned copy of the original backend `controller` and `routes` files.

Structure:

- controller/
  - AuthController.js
  - Clients.js
  - ClientsApi_v2.js
  - User.js
  - Tasks.js
  - Uploads.js
  - managerController.js
  - employeeController.js
  - adminController.js
  - VerifyToken.js
  - utils/RoleBasedLoginResponse.js

- routes/
  - adminRoutes.js
  - employeeRoutes.js
  - managerRoutes.js

Purpose:
- Provide a safe, simplified copy of the core controllers and routes for further cleanup or extraction.

Notes:
- This is a direct copy for safety; no deletions made to the original workspace.
- If you want me to delete originals or further trim controllers (e.g., remove deprecated code), confirm and I'll proceed.
